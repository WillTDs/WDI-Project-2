### HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS

Footy Finder is a website designed for people to find teams or players to play 5-a-side football in the London area. If you need more players you can post your team and people can find and message you if they would like to play. Alternatively as a player you can message a team with space if you're looking for a game.

You can also find a location near you and find and message the teams that play there.

### CHALLENGES

Ran into a few issues setting up authentication on the site. Tackled each systematically until it was fully functional. There were many features I wanted to implement on the website and database, but due to the short time frame I had to complete the project some of the more minor ones I decided not to add. I'll be revisiting the project to add them in the due course.   

### IMPROVEMENTS

I aim to add data such as league standings, fixtures and results to the database. In the future I would also like to add a team matching feature, where you could input your location and it would supply you with the nearest team with available space for another player.
